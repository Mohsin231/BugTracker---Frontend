### Backend API
>https://bug-tracker-apii.herokuapp.com/bugs/
### Project idea 
>Bug Tracker is an application that helps teams solve bugs more efficiently. It's an application where user can create a project and add their team members in it. If there are any bugs, any team member can create and post a bug so all of their team members can see it. Details about the bug include: name, priority, details, steps, operating system, assignee.

### Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
This project will be a full stack app. The frontend will use React.js and the backend will use Python, Django, MYSQL, and Postgres.
